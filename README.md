# ThingEngine

## Help the World Connect the Dots

ThingEngine is the workhorse behind ThingPedia, the open source platform for IoT rules
that you can execute anywhere you want.

ThingEngine comes in many form:

- As a phone app, for Android
- As an installable app for a home server
- As a web service hosted at <https://thingengine.stanford.edu>

This module contains a command line version of ThingEngine, which is mainly
useful for development and testing. Users should probably look at the
web service or the pre-built Android app.

ThingEngine is part of Open Thing Platform, a research project led by
prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.  You can find more
information at <http://thingengine.stanford.edu/about>. User
documentation is available in
[thingengine-core](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-core).
